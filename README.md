-hello, I am Joseph Hogan. Currently in college pursuing a degree in history with a minor in computer science. 
I know pretty strange to combine the two, but I enjoy studying the history of computer science.
Most of my time programming has been spent coding in C and C++, but I am starting to branch out by programming in Python.
